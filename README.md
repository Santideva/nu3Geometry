# Dynamic Geometric Morphing Visualizer

## üåê Project Overview

A cutting-edge WebGL-powered geometric visualization tool that dynamically morphs between complex shapes using advanced scalar field and signed distance function (SDF) techniques.

## ‚ú® Features

- Real-time geometric shape morphing
- Customizable shape transformations
- Comprehensive property-based geometry generation
- Performance-optimized WebGL rendering
- Detailed logging and debugging support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- Three.js
- Modern web browser with WebGL support

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spherical-morphing-visualizer.git
cd spherical-morphing-visualizer
npm install
npm start
```

## üî¨ Technical Highlights

- Dynamic Signed Distance Function (SDF) transformations
- Comprehensive geometric property matrix
- Scalar field-based shape generation
- Interpolative shape morphing

## üì¶ Core Components

- `SphericalCustomGeometry`: Custom geometry generation
- `ShapeMorphEngine`: Shape transformation logic
- `SphericalVisualizer`: WebGL rendering and interaction

## üß™ Shape Morphing Examples

```javascript
// Create visualizer
const visualizer = new SphericalVisualizer();

// Morph between shapes
visualizer.geometry.morphToShape("Cube", 2.0); // Morph to cube over 2 seconds
```

## üåà Supported Shapes

- Sphere
- Cube
- Cone
- Cylinder
- Torus
- Parabola
